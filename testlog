Test Log for JustRipe Farm - Software Project

[07/11/2018]
Project break (MAJOR): Upon uploading files that do not match config of other files, this breaks the entire project. This was learned when
a member of the team tried uploading the database. To fix this error in the future, files must be uploaded to different branches in the
project. Files seperated by branches will not break the project, but also allow us to evaluate and analyse files before going on to the 
master branch. Â¦ Repo has not been restored to correct order yet.
